This is a C program to multiply matrices from files dumped as input to stdin. It can easily be modified to read from other streams, however. It checks whether or not the input is valid, and, if it is, performs matrix multiplication and outputs a new matrix, by default, to stdout, although again, that can be trivially modified to output to a given file instead. Some example input files are included.
